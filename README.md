# Shopify Challenge

"This project is a Next.js application built to allow users to nominate their favorite films or series. It leverages TanStack Query to fetch data, manages loading states, and handles error handling. The project also utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling, Material-UI components for UI elements, and makes use of useEffect and local storage.

## Features

- **TanStack Query**: Simplifies data fetching, loading state management, and error handling for remote APIs.
- **Next.js**: Provides server-side rendering, optimized routing, and enhanced performance.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Enables rapid UI development with customizable styling.
- **Material-UI Components**: Integrates pre-designed components for an enhanced user interface.
- **useEffect**: Manages side effects, including fetching data from local storage.
- **Local Storage**: Persists selected movies across page refreshes using browser storage.
- **Debouncing**: Optimizes search functionality with a delay to reduce unnecessary API requests.
- **Loading State**: Displays loading indicators during data fetching for improved user feedback.

## ABOUT ME 
I am delighted that you have taken an interest in my project. At 26 years old, I hold a degree in mechanical engineering. Following graduation, I spent approximately five months working as an engineer in a specific field. However, during this time, I realized that the role did not align with my aspirations and overall satisfaction.

Driven by my passion for coding, software, and computer components, I extensively researched various career options, ultimately gravitating towards web development. The more I delved into this field, the stronger my interest grew. I became determined to excel as a talented frontend web developer. Notably, my engineering background has equipped me with highly organized and systematic work habits, facilitating effective learning and contributing significantly to my educational journey.

I hope this brief introduction has provided you with insight into my background and motivations without becoming overly tedious.
